\section{The harder option}
The harder option is for there to be a paradigm shift in the way NICE --- and health economics more generally --- operates. It could involve programme budgeting and marginal analysis, or the Birch and Gafni approach\cite{Ruta_2005,Birch_1992,Gafni_2006}. This might just be the best option, but it seems unlikely to happen nationally any time soon.
